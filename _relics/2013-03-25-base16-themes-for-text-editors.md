Always good to have some colour when you're hacking away in a text heavy environment. Whether it's the terminal or a text editor, I seem to fall back to a base16 theme from [chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson).

Base16 is available in a [range of styles](http://chriskempson.github.com/base16/) for just about every popular text environment.
