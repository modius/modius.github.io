I'm Geoff Bowers — an Antipodean with a Caledonian education. A short-term biochemist who sold his soul to the City, I eventually gave up derivatives to become a web entrepreneur.

I founded the Sydney [Daemonites](https://daemon.com.au), and have spent 25+ years building digital things across an eclectic mix of industries — from the Australian Olympic Team to publishing houses, universities, government bodies, and everything in between.

These days I'm mostly building with CFML, Docker, and whatever else gets the job done. I care about developer experience, pragmatic architecture, and shipping things that work.
