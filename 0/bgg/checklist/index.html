---

## ✅ Julie — Confirmed & Checked In

- [x] ~~Julie to confirm~~ ✅ Going — checked in
- [x] ~~Julie's check-in~~ ✅ Complete
- [ ] Confirm Julie's passport validity (6 months from departure = valid until at least 15 Aug 2026)
- [ ] Verify **Julie's** badge (#176) on tabletop.events matches 5:00 PM Main Dining

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL — Do Immediately (Before Feb 15)

### 🚨 Stateroom Request Form — Deadline TODAY (Feb 13)
RC's pre-cruise email says the Stateroom Form for optional requests is only accepted **2 days prior to sailing**. That's today.

- [ ] **Submit Stateroom Request Form** — any cabin preferences (bed configuration, special requests, etc.). Access via the link in the RC email or app. If you miss the deadline, ask your stateroom attendant on boarding day.

### 1. Royal Caribbean App + Check-In
- [x] ~~Download the **Royal Caribbean app** (iOS / Android)~~ ✅ Done
- [x] ~~**Complete online check-in for Geoff**~~ ✅ Travel info done, arrival time **2:30pm Feb 15**
  - [x] ~~Upload photo~~ ✅
  - [x] ~~Enter travel document info (passport details)~~ ✅
  - [x] ~~Select arrival time at port~~ ✅ 2:30pm
  - [ ] Complete health declaration — **opens Feb 14**
  - [ ] Set up **SeaPass account** (link a credit/debit card) — check if done. ℹ️ Onboard charges are in **USD** — a credit card hold is placed daily against your spend. Extra authorisations returned 7–10 business days after the cruise.
  - [ ] **E-muster steps 1 & 2:** Watch the safety video and listen to the emergency horn in the app — can be completed the **night before** (Feb 14). Step 3 (muster station check-in) is done on board.
- [x] ~~Complete online check-in for **Julie Steadman**~~ ✅ Checked in
- [ ] Review the **safety videos** in the app (red life preserver button) — part of e-muster
- [ ] **Tell your bank you're travelling** — RC infographic recommends this to avoid card blocks. Charges are in USD.
- [x] ~~Note your **Muster Station** location~~ ✅ **Muster Station D1**
- [x] ~~Obtain your **SetSail Pass**~~ ✅ Available in app

> ℹ️ **Arrival time is 2:30pm** — the earliest slot available. Ship sails at 5:00pm (all aboard ~4pm). You'll miss The Key welcome lunch (noon–1:30pm) but have plenty of buffer. Both Geoff and Julie are checked in.
>
> ⚠️ **RC pre-cruise email (Feb 13):** Arrive during your pre-selected arrival time — you risk being turned away if you arrive outside it. Keep SetSail Pass and travel documents **in hand** (don't pack them in checked luggage or you may be denied boarding).

### 2. Verify Passport Expiry
- [x] ~~Confirm **Geoff's** passport is valid until at least **27 August 2026** (6 months after return date)~~ ✅ Confirmed
- [ ] Confirm **Julie's** passport validity (must be valid until at least 15 Aug 2026)
- [ ] Confirm names on both passports match the legal names on the RC booking

### 3. Verify Badge Info — Dining CONFIRMED ✅
The RC Guest Ticket Booklet confirms **Dining: 5:00 PM** — you're on **Main Dining** with the BGG group. Still worth verifying on tabletop.events that it matches.

- [x] ~~Verify **Geoff's** dining preference~~ ✅ **5:00 PM Main Dining** (confirmed in Guest Ticket Booklet)
- [ ] Verify **Julie's** badge (#176) matches on tabletop.events — should also be 5:00 PM Main Dining
- [ ] If anything looks wrong, email the organisers ASAP: **info@tabletop.events** or **jeff@qwyx.events**

> **Main Dining** = 5:00pm, seated with other gamers (most people are on this). ✅ **You're on this.**

---

## 🟡 IMPORTANT — Do Before Sailing

### 4. New Zealand Traveller Declaration (NZTD)
Required for **all** passengers, including Australian citizens. Free, takes ~10 minutes.

- [ ] Download the **NZTD app** now (Apple App Store / Google Play) — requires internet to download, so do this before the ship
- [ ] Alternatively, bookmark: **www.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz/cruise**
- [ ] Submit declaration for **Geoff** — can only be submitted from 24 hours before **arriving in NZ** (not before departure). First NZ waters are Feb 18 (sounds), first port is Feb 19 (Dunedin) — so submit from ~Feb 17. RC may also provide a paper form as backup.
- [ ] Submit declaration for **Julie** — separate declaration required for each traveller

### 5. Things You Do NOT Need (as Australian Citizens)
Good news — these requirements from the emails do **not** apply to you:

- ~~Australian ETA~~ — Not required (you're citizens)
- ~~NZeTA~~ — Not required (Australian citizens are exempt)

### 6. Packing Essentials

**Carry-on bag** (luggage is dropped at the terminal and delivered to your room later that evening — keep essentials with you):

- [ ] Passport(s) — **in hand at all times through terminal**
- [ ] **SetSail Pass** (app or printed backup) — **in hand at all times**
- [ ] Medications (keep in carry-on, not checked luggage)
- [ ] **Travel adaptor** — two-pin North American or European power outlets (confirmed by RC infographic)
- [ ] Swimmers / change of clothes (staterooms not ready until ~1pm)
- [ ] Sunscreen
- [ ] Phone charger
- [ ] Valuables

**Checked luggage:**

- [ ] **Print luggage tags** from Vacation Documents (RC app or email) — attach to bags before arriving at port
- [ ] Formal/smart casual attire — RC has **theme nights** including 'Dress Your Best'. Check the Daily Planner → 'Tonight's Attire' in the app for each evening.
- [ ] Medications (12+ days' worth, plus spares in case of delays — keep a supply in carry-on too)
- [ ] Seasickness remedies if you're prone (first day or two at sea, plus Milford/Doubtful Sound scenic cruising can be choppy)
- [ ] **Reef-safe sunscreen** and hat (NZ summer, February) — RC recommends avoiding petrolatum, titanium dioxide, oxybenzone, octocrylene, octinoxate
- [ ] Any board games you want to bring (there's a community geeklist for attendee-brought games)
- [ ] Lanyard or cardholder for your SeaPass card — you'll carry it everywhere on the ship
- [ ] Day bag/small backpack for port excursions
- [ ] Refillable water bottle for shore excursions
- [ ] **Overnight bag** for last night at sea — staff collect main luggage the evening before disembarkation; keep night clothes, toiletries, and next-day outfit in an overnight bag

> 🚫 **Prohibited items (confiscated by Security):** Kettles, coffee makers, cooking appliances, clothing irons, travel steamers, extension cords, multi-plug outlets, power strips, sports gear (skateboards, surfboards, etc.), alcoholic beverages (beer, seltzer, spirits). If you were planning to bring a power strip for charging — don't. Bring individual chargers or a multi-port USB charger instead (generally allowed). Your Junior Suite has a **Lavazza espresso machine** so you don't need a coffee maker.

---

## 🟢 Boarding Day — Sunday 15 February

Since you live near Sydney, you'll head to the port on the day.

**Terminal:** Overseas Passenger Terminal, The Rocks — Corner of Argyle and George Streets, Circular Quay West, The Rocks NSW 2000 ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/4d8iKxxY7hH2)). No long-term parking at the pier — ride-share or drop-off. Check for CBD road closures before heading out.

- [ ] **Verify travel documents** — RC email says guests without all necessary documents will be denied boarding. Confirm passport + SetSail Pass are ready and in hand.
- [ ] Plan transport to port — ride-share or drop-off (no parking available)

> 🍷 **Alcohol policy:** Each guest may bring **1 sealed 750ml bottle of wine or champagne** on embarkation day (carry-on only — wine in checked luggage won't be delivered to room until after sailing). Non-alcoholic beverages: max 12 standard cans/bottles per stateroom. Drinking age is 18 (departing Australia/NZ).

> ℹ️ **Pro tip from RC:** Staterooms won't be ready upon early boarding. Arriving later means shorter lines at the Windjammer and quicker access to your stateroom. Your 2:30pm arrival time is actually well-timed for this.

### The Key — Boarding Day Perks
- **Welcome lunch** on Deck 4 Main Dining Room, noon–1:30pm (exclusive to Key holders)
- **Carry-on luggage drop-off** at Deck 4 Main Dining Room until 1:30pm (delivered to your cabin, max 2 bags, 25lbs each)
- Note: RC states priority boarding access is **not offered at Australian ports** — so the priority check-in lane may not apply in Sydney. You'll still benefit from The Key at NZ ports and onboard.

### Terminal Steps (from RC infographic)
1. Arrive at your pre-selected arrival time (2:30pm)
2. Have passport + SetSail Pass **in hand** as you enter the terminal
3. Drop checked luggage at the allocated area (luggage tags must be attached)
4. Proceed through the terminal — all guests go through security screening

### Once On Board
- [ ] **Turn on airplane mode** immediately to avoid international roaming charges once the ship sails
- [ ] Connect to WiFi: select **'WIFI-GUEST-SHIP'** (The Key includes VOOM Surf+Stream)
- [ ] **Report to Muster Station D1** — crew will scan your SetSail Pass (step 3 of e-muster, mandatory)
- [ ] Enjoy The Key **welcome lunch** (Deck 4, noon–1:30pm) — you'll arrive at 2:30pm so likely missed
- [ ] Grab food at **Windjammer, Café@Two70, or Sorrento's Pizza** (all open on boarding day)
- [ ] Cabins available from ~**1:00pm** (announcement when ready)
- [ ] Collect your **SeaPass cards** from the mail slot next to your cabin door
  - Verify the names are correct (legal names matching passports)
  - Test that the cards work on the door
  - Note your dining table assignment on the card
- [ ] **Check in with Jeff or Kristine** before dinner — dining table assignments are often wrong and they can fix them
- [ ] Visit the **Conference Centre, Deck 13 AFT** — the BGG@SEA hub. They'll have goodies and info. (Note: you walk through a hallway of cabins to get there.)
- [ ] **Book specialty restaurants for 20% off** — The Key perk, must be reserved on Day 1. Do this early!
- [ ] **Reserve show seats** — required on Quantum-class ships (Anthem). Royal Theater, AquaTheater, Studio B, Two70.

> 💡 **Hot tip from RC:** Digital signage is located next to elevators on every deck. Can't find your room? Enter your room number and it will show you the way!

## ❓ Decisions / Things to Consider

### Māori Lunch with Game Designers (Wellington — Day 7, Feb 21)
**Location:** Te Papa, Wellington waterfront (right by the national museum)
**Weta tour bus** can drop you at the waterfront near the restaurant. Otherwise make your own way there by 1:00pm.

Two options:
- **Just Lunch** — NZD$120 (~US$70)
  - 1:00–1:30pm arrive, find seats
  - 1:30–2:30pm lunch (authentic Māori food)
  - 2:45–4:15pm free time in Wellington
  - 4:15pm bus return from Te Papa to port
- **Lunch + Designer Session** — NZD$150 (~US$90)
  - 1:00–1:30pm arrive, find seats
  - 1:30–2:30pm lunch
  - 2:45–4:00pm facilitated session with Garphill Games designers (Q&A, Design Clinic, "what you didn't see in the final game")
  - 4:15pm bus return from Te Papa to port

> ⚠️ Bus return at 4:15pm, gangway closes 4:30pm — only **15 minutes buffer**. The "just lunch" option gives you more flexibility to get back early on your own.

**Did you sign up for this?** If so, **fill out the form** on tabletop.events (linked from the purchase page). If not, it may still be available — email **jeff@qwyx.events** to ask.

### RC Shore Excursions
- [x] ~~**LOTR & Weta Workshop Tour** — Wellington (Day 7, Feb 21), 8:00am, 1 guest (Geoffrey), $219.00~~ ✅ Booked
  - Tour should get you back in time for the Māori Lunch at Te Papa (1pm) if you've booked that too
- [ ] Check RC app for other available excursions at remaining ports (many may be sold out)

### ✅ Dining Preferences — CONFIRMED
Guest Ticket Booklet confirms **5:00 PM Main Dining**. You're with the BGG group.

- [x] ~~Dining confirmed~~ ✅ **5:00 PM Main Dining** — seated with other BGG gamers.

There's also a **table request form** on tabletop.events to request being seated with specific people. By default, everyone in the same cabin is assigned to the same table.

## 🎲 Board Game Convention — How It Works

This is a BGG (BoardGameGeek) convention at sea. Here's what to expect if it's your first time.

### The Game Room & Library
- **Location:** Conference Centre, Deck 13 AFT — this is the BGG@SEA hub
- **Access:** Your Game Room Access badge (paid, $150) gets you in. General cruise passengers cannot enter. Wear your wristband/badge visibly.
- **Hours:** 24/7 access for badge holders
- **Library:** 300+ games available to borrow. You can check out **one base game (plus its expansions) at a time**. Play in the game room or take it elsewhere on the ship.
- **Additional space:** Reserved dining areas are used for overflow gaming during the day, and the Windjammer buffet area in the evening.

### Finding Games & Players
- **Discord server** — Join the BGG@SEA Discord ([discord.gg/hWFMq94BH8](https://discord.gg/hWFMq94BH8)) and check the **#game-scheduling** channel to organise games you really want to play before you even board.
- **"Players Wanted" signs** — look for these on tables in the game room. People set them up when they want others to join.
- **"Teachers Wanted" signs** — someone has a game and wants to learn or teach it. Great way to try something new.
- **Just ask** — approaching a table and asking "Room for one more?" or "What are you playing?" is completely normal and expected. Board gamers are a welcoming bunch.
- **Attendee-brought games** — beyond the library, people bring their own games. There's a community GeekList tracking what people are bringing.
- **Sea days are peak gaming** — port days tend to have gaming in the evenings after everyone's back from excursions.

### Etiquette & Tips
- **Joining tables:** Perfectly fine to ask strangers if you can join. That's the whole point of the convention.
- **Be present:** No phones at the table during a game. Stay engaged.
- **Don't "quarterback"** — avoid telling other players what they should do, even if you can see a better move.
- **Don't touch other players' pieces** without asking.
- **Be gracious** — good winner, good loser. It's a social event first.
- **Announce your turns** — say what you're doing, especially in games with newer players. It helps everyone follow along.
- **Plan ahead** — think about your next move during others' turns so you're not holding things up.
- **Hygiene matters** — long days in a shared space. Shower, deodorant, clean hands. This is genuinely one of the most common bits of convention advice.
- **Don't attend the game room if you're unwell** — close quarters, shared components. If you pick up a bug, game in your cabin instead.

### Convention Events
- **Welcome Reception (Day 2, 7–8pm Music Hall):** Complimentary appetisers and drinks, meet other players.
- **Open gaming:** The core of the convention. Self-directed, play what you want, when you want.
- **Learn-to-play sessions:** Sometimes organised for popular or complex games.
- **Māori Lunch with Game Designers (Wellington):** Special off-ship event if you signed up.
- **Check the whiteboard** in the game room regularly for event announcements and schedule changes.

## 📍 Day-by-Day Itinerary

> **Port times explained:** The Guest Ticket Booklet shows **ship arrival/departure** times. The RC app shows **gangway open/close** times (narrower — gangway opens after arrival for clearance, closes before departure). Use the gangway times for planning when you can get off and must be back. All NZ ports are **DOCK** (not tender) — you walk straight off the ship.
