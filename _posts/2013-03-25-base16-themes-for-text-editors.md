Always good to have some colour when your hacking away in a text heavy environment. Whether its the terminal or a textmate I seem to fall back to a base16 theme from [chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson).

Base16 via [https://github.com/chriskempson/base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)

Base16 is available in a [range of styles](http://chriskempson.github.com/base16/) for just about every popular text environment. Enjoy!
